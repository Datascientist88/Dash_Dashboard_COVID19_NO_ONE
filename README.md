DATA VISUALIZATION WITH PLOTLY & DASH  
Covid 19 Real-time Dashboard project  
Introduction: 
The most important skill a data scientist must master is Data visualization  and the ability to use numbers to tell Stories to relevant stakeholders and users , communicating a complicated piece of information in an understandable manner is of paramount importance , there is an abundance data visualization libraries in python , but what makes plotly and dash particularly appealing for me is the fact that you can create and deploy your own dashboards fairly easily added to that is the fascinating interactivity that engages the user and invites them to play and interact with charts , amazingly I realized data science is not only about statistics , mathematics , and programming there is also artistic aspect added to these components that comprise data science , using plotly graph objects enables you to design , customize graph shapes and colors which is the quintessence of arts, I started this project last week , and as usual I was confronted with a lot problems and challenges in producing and deploying this interactive web application  . 
The application concept: 
This  dashboard extracts data from a data source using URL , thus it gets automatically updated as the data is updated in the data source enabling the user to gain real-time insights into the trajectory of the pandemic , off course one might argue that covid 19 pandemic is over , but I would to reiterate the fact that is just a demonstration as to how to apply plotly and dash to build interactive dashboards for all purposes , dash library is built on top java script , flask and react JS , as well as it has HTML and BOOTSTRAP components which makes it  an extraordinarily powerful tool for designing dashboards which fit all setting including mobile phone screens and thus making it user friendly , basically I used plotly graph objects to build the charts and then create the layout i.e. the rows and columns in the web page , place those charts within these columns and add interactivity to my dashboard I have defined a set of call back functions that link the charts with interactive components input in my case the dropdown menu , in a nutshell it just filters the data that feeds the chart figures  
 
 Conclusion: 
I would like to conclude by stating the fact that data science is an enormous field with big potential and data visualization is only one aspect of it , using plotly graph objects along with dash enables a data scientist to draw a picture that worths a thousand words.
